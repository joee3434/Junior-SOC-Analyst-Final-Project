REAL SIEM ALERTS – SOC101
AMIT Cybersecurity Final Project

Group 100 – Eng. Taha Abouelhgag
Role: Junior SOC Analyst

1. Introduction

This report presents an analysis of real phishing alerts detected by a SIEM platform as part of the SOC101 module. The objective of this task is to simulate the workflow of a Junior SOC Analyst by investigating low-severity alerts, identifying potential threats, and providing appropriate recommendations to reduce organizational risk.

Although the alerts are classified as low severity, phishing attacks remain one of the most common initial attack vectors used by threat actors. Therefore, proper investigation and documentation are essential.

2. Alert Overview

Alert Name: SOC101 – Phishing Mail Detected

Severity: Low

Source System: Microsoft Exchange

Alert Type: Email Phishing

Total Alerts Analyzed: 4

Time Range: August 2020 – February 2021

3. Alert Analysis Questions

Q1: What is the rule detecting?
The rule detects phishing emails that attempt to deceive recipients into clicking malicious links, downloading malicious attachments, or providing sensitive information such as credentials.

Q2: What system generates these alerts?
The alerts are generated by Microsoft Exchange, which is responsible for handling and monitoring organizational email traffic.

Q3: How many similar alerts were detected?
A total of four similar phishing alerts were detected over a period of approximately six months.

Q4: What is the severity and why?
The alerts are classified as Low severity because there is no confirmed evidence of user interaction or system compromise. However, phishing alerts still require investigation due to their potential to escalate into serious security incidents.

Q5: What is the analyst’s task?
The analyst is responsible for investigating the alerts by reviewing email details, analyzing headers, extracting and validating Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), and correlating findings with other security data sources.

4. Detailed Alert Analysis
Alert 1

Event ID: 59

Event Time: Feb 14, 2021 – 03:00 AM

Rule: SOC101 – Phishing Mail Detected

SMTP Address: 27.128.173.81

Source Address: hahaha@ihackedyourcomputer.com

Destination Address: mark@letsdefend.io

Email Subject: I hacked your computer

Device Action: Blocked

Analysis:
This alert represents a classic intimidation-based phishing attempt. The sender uses a threatening subject line to pressure the victim into taking immediate action. The sender domain is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate organization.

Risk Assessment:
Low severity, as the email was successfully blocked and no user interaction occurred.

Recommendation:
Continue blocking similar sender patterns and educate users about scare-based phishing techniques.

Alert 2

Event ID: 34

Event Time: Dec 05, 2020 – 10:33 PM

Rule: SOC101 – Phishing Mail Detected

SMTP Address: 112.85.42.180

Source Address: admin@netflix-payments.com

Destination Address: emily@letsdefend.io

Email Subject: Netflix Deals!

Device Action: Allowed

Analysis:
This alert impersonates a well-known brand (Netflix) to lure the recipient with promotional offers. The sender domain is not an official Netflix domain, indicating a spoofing attempt.

Risk Assessment:
Low severity, but higher risk compared to blocked emails since the message was allowed to reach the user inbox.

Recommendation:
Implement stricter email filtering rules for brand impersonation and review SPF/DKIM/DMARC policies.

Alert 3

Event ID: 27

Event Time: Oct 29, 2020 – 07:25 PM

Rule: SOC101 – Phishing Mail Detected

SMTP Address: 146.56.209.252

Source Address: ndt@zol.co.zw

Destination Address: susie@letsdefend.io

Email Subject: UPS Your Packages Status Has Changed

Device Action: Blocked

Analysis:
This phishing email attempts to exploit trust in a logistics company (UPS) by claiming a package status update. The sender domain does not belong to UPS, indicating spoofing.

Risk Assessment:
Low severity, as the email was blocked before reaching the user.

Recommendation:
Maintain domain reputation checks and continue monitoring shipping-related phishing campaigns.

Alert 4

Event ID: 8

Event Time: Aug 29, 2020 – 11:05 PM

Rule: SOC101 – Phishing Mail Detected

SMTP Address: 63.35.133.186

Source Address: info@nexoiberica.com

Destination Address: mark@letsdefend.io

Email Subject: UPS Express

Device Action: Allowed

Analysis:
This alert shows another delivery-themed phishing attempt. The vague subject line and non-official sender domain increase suspicion.

Risk Assessment:
Low severity, but the email being allowed increases the potential risk if user interaction occurs.

Recommendation:
Enhance filtering for logistics-related phishing emails and raise user awareness regarding fake delivery notifications.

5. Conclusion

This investigation demonstrates the importance of analyzing even low-severity alerts in a SOC environment. Phishing attacks remain a primary attack vector, and early detection combined with proper response can prevent serious incidents. Through alert investigation, IOC validation, and documentation, the analyst strengthens both technical and analytical SOC skills.

6. Lessons Learned

Low severity does not mean no risk

Brand impersonation is a common phishing technique

Email filtering and user awareness are critical defense layers

Documentation is a key skill for SOC analysts
